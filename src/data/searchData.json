Recently, Bangladesh has embraced this trend over the last year and a half, with Nexdecade pioneering the development of its own hardware and software for OTT services. Currently, we oversee operations for Bengal Screen and Toffee.\nThe expansion of OTT services owes much to advancements in broadband infrastructure and the strategic distribution efforts of content providers, including Pay TV operators. These strategies have extended OTT platforms beyond traditional television to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Pay TV providers are actively broadening their OTT offerings to enrich subscriber experiences with abundant content, ensuring seamless access to Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live TV across multiple devices. To stay ahead in this dynamic market and meet evolving subscriber demands, we have secured cutting-edge OTT platforms, particularly in Android TV, enhancing VOD capabilities across secondary devices.",

          "description": "Television broadcasting has undergone substantial transformation in recent years, becoming more diverse and digital-centric. One prominent shift is the increasing digitization of television networks, particularly evident in cable systems. This trend is driven by the advantages of value-added services such as customizable channel packs, interactive content, high-definition channels, and on-demand video offerings. Furthermore, government mandates requiring the installation of set-top boxes (STBs) in countries like China and India have contributed significantly to the rapid expansion of the global STB market. Amidst these developments, a select group of top manufacturers dominate the industry, shaping its evolution.",
