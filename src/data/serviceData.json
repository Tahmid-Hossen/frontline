Recently, Bangladesh has embraced this trend over the last year and a half, with Nexdecade pioneering the development of its own hardware and software for OTT services. Currently, we oversee operations for Bengal Screen and Toffee.\nThe expansion of OTT services owes much to advancements in broadband infrastructure and the strategic distribution efforts of content providers, including Pay TV operators. These strategies have extended OTT platforms beyond traditional television to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Pay TV providers are actively broadening their OTT offerings to enrich subscriber experiences with abundant content, ensuring seamless access to Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live TV across multiple devices. To stay ahead in this dynamic market and meet evolving subscriber demands, we have secured cutting-edge OTT platforms, particularly in Android TV, enhancing VOD capabilities across secondary devices.",
